# Info on ATMS (application timing management system) analysis

# Overview
* Estimates of the effect of ATMS on emission after applying animal slurry to the field are made here using the ALFAM2 model for 4 different countries.
For each country, a different approach was used, demonstrating some variation in what could be qualify as ATMS.
* All files have been denoted with a two-letter ID for each country. CA: Canada, IE: Ireland, ES: Spain, DK: Denmark. 

# Scenario A
IE, Ireland. Application during all days in May versus only rainy days. Rainy days were identified with an arbitrary constraint: at least 2 mm of precipitation within the first 6 hours after slurry application. 
* Slurry properties and source of these can be found in ../slurry-properties/slurry_prop.xlsx.
* Source of manure management: ../manure-management/IE_Manure-Management.... and expert judgement by S. Connolly.

# Scenario B
ES, Spain. Application during low or high emission days in June. Low emission days selected using 24 hr cumulative emission predictions from ALFAM2 model. Weather data were daily averages for 2023 and 2024. 
* Slurry properties and source of these can be found in ../slurry-properties/slurry_prop.xlsx.
* Source of manure management: ../manure-management/ES_informeaualdeimplanta.... and expert judgement by A. S. CÃµbena.

# Scenario C
CA, Canada. Spring application (April, low emission) compared to summer (August). Weather were daily averages for 17 years (2007 - 2023).
* Slurry properties and source of these can be found in ../slurry-properties/slurry_prop.xlsx.
* Source of manure management: ../manure-management/CA_Manure management.... and expert judgement by D. Pelster.

# Scenario D
DK, Denmark. Evening application (21.00, low emission) compared to morning application (9.00, reference condition), all in April. Weather were hourly averages for 3 years (2021-2023).
* Slurry properties and source of these can be found in ../slurry-properties/slurry_prop.xlsx.
* Source of manure management: ../manure-management/DK_Birkmose.... and expert judgement by J. Pedersen and S. D. Hafner.
